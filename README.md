# Instructions and template for Assignment 1

The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that you are becoming more comfortable working with Python scripting and working with Github. Additionally, this assignment will demonstrate that you are comfortable with the Github Classroom workflow that we'll be using this semester.

## Task

In the Advanced Scientific Computing workshop, we wrote a short piece of code which loaded a CSV file, created a scatter plot with a regression line plotted over the top, and saved the results.

For assignment 1, I want to turn that into a ```.py``` script and which reads the contents of ```data/height-weight.csv``` and produces an output.

The goal of this assignment is to make sure that you feel comfortable using Github Classrooms for assignment work.
